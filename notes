Your $500 Wing Strategy (Optimized for Best ROI)
Current Wing Analysis:
Annica's positions show he's betting AGAINST:

Low end: 20-99 (very cheap wings)
High end: 280+ (more expensive, but still wings)
Key insight from market prices:

CHEAPEST wings: <20 (0.3¢), 20-39 (0.2¢), 40-59 (0.2¢), 60-79 (0.2¢), 80-99 (0.3¢)
Expensive wings: 300-319 (10¢), 320-339 (9¢), 340-359 (8¢)
Problem with copying Annica:

He bought 300-319 @ 91¢ (now 92¢) = Already made profit
He bought 320-339 @ 92¢ (now 93¢) = Already made profit
You'd buy at 92-93¢ = WORSE entry, less upside!
Your Optimal $500 Wing Allocation:
Total wing budget: $10-12 (2-2.5% of capital)

Remaining $488-490 for body + hedges later.

Strategy: Buy ONLY the cheapest wings
Low End Wings ($6):

High End Wings ($6):

Total: $12.00

Why These Specific Buckets?
Low End (20-79):

Cheapest possible (0.2¢!)
Elon averaged 30+ tweets/day recently = 210+ weekly
20-79 would need 3-11 tweets/day = extremely unlikely
ROI if they expire at 0¢: 500% (you keep 100% of yield)
High End (440-499):

440-459 @ 0.5¢ = Still cheap
480-499 @ 0.8¢ = Reasonable
Would need 63-71 tweets/day = extremely unlikely
ROI if expire at 0¢: 100-200%
Why NOT Copy Annica's Expensive Wings?
Annica has:

300-319 @ 91¢ (now 92¢) = $1,820 invested
320-339 @ 92¢ (now 93¢) = $1,840 invested
Problems for you:

Already moved: He bought cheaper, already profiting
Capital inefficient: $1,820 to make ~$150 profit (8% ROI)
Better alternatives: $3 on 20-39 can make $3 profit (100% ROI)
Math:

Spend $1,820 on 300-319 @ 92¢ → Make $160 if expires at 0¢ = 9% ROI
Spend $3 on 20-39 @ 0.2¢ → Make $3 if expires at 0¢ = 100% ROI

Wings are yield farming - maximize ROI per dollar
Cheapest = Best - 0.2¢ > 92¢ for wings
Save capital - More money for body = more profit potential
Don't chase Annica's entries - He got better prices earlier
Your $12 wing investment will likely return $12 profit (100% ROI), while saving $488 for the big body construction where the real money is made! 🎯
