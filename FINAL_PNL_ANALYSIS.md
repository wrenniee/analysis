# Final PnL Analysis (Nov 18 - Nov 25)

Based on the provided resolution data, here is the definitive breakdown of the trader's performance.

## The Big Picture
*   **Total Profit:** **~$43,000** (Estimated from the big wins minus losses)
*   **Strategy Validation:** The "Yield Farm + Moonshot" strategy was executed, but the "Moonshot" target shifted from `500+` (in our early data) to the `200-219` range.

## The Winners (The "Moonshot" Landed)
The trader made their massive profits on two specific "Yes" buckets.
1.  **Yes 200-219**:
    *   **Bet:** $31,734
    *   **Payout:** $82,777
    *   **Profit:** **+$51,042**
    *   **ROI:** 160%
2.  **Yes 140-159**:
    *   **Bet:** $4,739
    *   **Payout:** $16,518
    *   **Profit:** **+$11,778**
    *   **ROI:** 248%

## The Losers (The Cost of Business)
The trader took significant losses on their "No" positions (Yield Farm) and some failed "Yes" bets.
1.  **No 140-159 (Hedging Gone Wrong)**:
    *   **Loss:** **-$10,348**
    *   **Insight:** They were betting *against* this bucket (buying No) while also betting *for* it (buying Yes). This is a classic "Straddle" or hedge that partially failed, but the "Yes" win covered it.
2.  **No 200-219**:
    *   **Loss:** **-$3,373**
    *   **Insight:** Same pattern. They held both Yes and No on the winning bucket.
3.  **Failed Moonshots (Yes 220-299)**:
    *   **Loss:** ~$4,500 combined.
    *   **Insight:** These were the other "Yes" buckets they accumulated but didn't hit.

## The "Yield Farm" (No Bets)
*   **No 20-39, 40-59, etc.**: These show "$0.00" profit/loss in your text, but "Lost" status. This is confusing.
    *   If they bought "No" on `20-39` and the result was `200-219`, they **WON** the "No" bet.
    *   The text says "Lost" but "Amount Won" equals "Total Bet". This implies a **Push** or a **Break-even** exit, OR the data format is tricky.
    *   *Correction*: If they bought "No" and the event didn't happen, they keep the $1. The "Lost" label might refer to the *opportunity cost* or a specific platform display quirk where "Winning the No bet" is displayed differently.
    *   **Key Takeaway**: They didn't lose money on the low-bucket "No" bets. They likely made their small 1-2% yield as planned.

## Conclusion
The trader is **NOT** just a passive yield farmer. They are an **Active Directional Trader** who uses yield farming to subsidize massive directional bets.
*   **The Alpha:** They correctly identified the `140-220` range as the target.
*   **The Execution:** They hammered "Yes" on these buckets (`140-159`, `200-219`) with size ($35k+).
*   **The Hedge:** They held "No" positions on the same buckets to dampen volatility.

**Final Verdict:** A highly sophisticated strategy that combines:
1.  **Safe Yield** (Low/High No's)
2.  **Directional Aggression** (Mid-Range Yes's)
3.  **Hedging** (Holding Yes & No on the same active bucket)
