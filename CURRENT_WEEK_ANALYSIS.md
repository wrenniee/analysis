# Current Week Analysis (Dec 9 - Dec 16)

**Date:** December 6, 2025 (3 Days Pre-Market)
**Trader Status:** Early Phase / Yield Farming

## Analysis of Current Positions

The trader's current portfolio for the upcoming week confirms the **Phase 1: Yield Farming** theory but with a defensive twist compared to the previous dataset.

### 1. The "Yield Farm" is in Full Swing
The trader has deployed significant capital (~$5,000+) into **"No"** positions.
*   **Low Buckets (`20-119`)**: Buying "No" @ ~99.8¢.
    *   **Yield**: ~0.2% - 0.5%.
    *   **Logic**: "Free money." Betting the count won't be impossibly low.
*   **Mid Buckets (`300-339`)**: Buying "No" @ ~91¢ - 92¢.
    *   **Yield**: ~8% - 9%.
    *   **Logic**: Taking a view that the count will likely be higher than this range.
*   **High Buckets (`480-500+`)**: Buying "No" @ ~99.2¢.
    *   **Yield**: ~0.8%.
    *   **Logic**: **Crucial Difference.** Last week he was *Long* these buckets. This week, he is *Shorting* them (betting it won't go that high).

### 2. The "Moonshot" is Dormant (or Targeted)
*   **Position**: `Yes 460-479`
*   **Size**: 75 shares.
*   **Cost**: 0.2¢ ($0.002).
*   **Value**: $0.83.
*   **Analysis**: This is negligible size. It is likely a "fishing" limit order that got filled at the absolute floor. He is **not** aggressively accumulating "Yes" shares yet.

## Does this support the strategy?

**Yes, it supports Phase 1 (Safety/Yield).**
*   He is currently in "Capital Preservation" mode.
*   He is farming small yields on high-probability outcomes (betting against the tails).

**Key Deviation: Bearish on the Super-Highs**
*   Unlike the previous analysis where he accumulated `500+`, he is currently **Shorting** `500+` (buying "No").
*   **Why?**
    *   **Valuation**: Paying 99.2¢ for "No" is a safe 0.8% return if he believes 500+ is impossible this week.
    *   **Sentiment Change**: He might not be as bullish this week.
    *   **Timing**: He might flip this position later. If `500+` odds drop (price of "No" goes up to 99.9¢), he sells for a profit. If odds rise (price of "No" drops), he might stop out and flip to "Yes".

## Conclusion
He is currently **Yield Farming**. He is collecting pennies on "No" bets across the board. He has **not** pulled the trigger on the aggressive "Bullish Accumulation" strategy yet.

**Watch for:**
*   A sudden stop in "No" buying on the High Buckets.
*   A spike in volume on `Yes 400-479`.
